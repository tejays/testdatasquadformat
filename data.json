From the beginning, we have had a very strong focus on maintaining our high-quality learning outcomes as we scale. Over the last 10 months, we have been able to figure out many processes, complementing human psychology, to facilitate deep-rooted learning.” “At this point, we are receiving double-digit thousand student applications every month and are very excited about the scale of impact we will be able to deliver through our tech-first approach,\" he added.AttainU Founders (L-R) - Vaibhav Bajpai, Divyam GoelAlso Read[Funding alert] EdTech startup Board Infinity raises Rs 2.2 Cr from multiple angel investors  Founded by Divyam Goel and Vaibhav Bajpai in 2018, AttainU currently offers full-time, online seven-month-long software engineering courses for users.  The startup provides career counselling as part of their student assessment process and connects graduates to industry partners for placement upon completion of the course. AttainU aims to serve students who have a college education but don't have a job or a satisfactory job and more importantly, don't need to have prior coding experience.  The company said its courses are focussed on industry-aligned practical skills and professionally required life skills and follow a deferred fee payment model conditional to employment aka Income Share Agreement (ISA).  Commenting on the angel round, Nikhil Rungta, ex-Intuit India MD, said,  \"Over 60 percent of the engineering students who pass out every year are either unemployed or are stuck in unrelated jobs. If we go beyond engineers, this problem multiplies 10 times. I feel the team at AttainU has identified this huge unsolved problem and are trying to solve it in a tech-first, structured and scalable way.\" According to AttainU, every year approximately nine million students graduate from colleges, out of which 85 percent don't make it to well paying, white collar jobs. Data states that 50 percent of all BE/Btech graduates and 60 percent of all MBA (including PG Diploma) graduates are still considered not employable by tech first organisations. “The team at AttainU has identified this huge unsolved problem and are trying to solve it in a tech-first, structured and scalable way. Divyam and Vaibhav have been able to put together a good team which not only has domain expertise but is also passionate about solving this huge problem,” added Nikhil.(Edited by Evelyn Ratnakumar)Also ReadEdtech startup Toppr raises $35 M from Kaizen Private Equity and existing investors\"",

Founded by IIT Delhi alumni Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal in 2015, Meesho has created an alternate distribution channel by empowering housewives, young mothers, aspiring entrepreneurs, students, and teachers, to launch, build, and promote their online businesses using WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and other social media channels. Its app is available in more than seven local languages other than English, and about 40 percent of its daily usage comes from a non-English speaking audience. Team at MeeshoAlso ReadBeyond Flipkart and Amazon, a new breed of startups is powering small sellers to ride the ecomm...The company said that the new funds will allow the company to make deeper inroads in areas outside India's major metro regions, by creating more entrepreneurs, and as a result, reaching remote customers not serviced by traditional ecommerce marketplaces. The latest investment will also strengthen Meesho's aim to grow its community of women entrepreneurs who have dreamt of running their own businesses but lacked the funds and expertise to do so, it added in a statement.Vidit Aatrey, Meesho Co-founder and CEO said, “I am particularly proud that Meesho has cut across gender, education levels, risk appetites, and vocations to create livelihoods for people with no investment of their own. Our social sellers are small retailers, women, students and retired citizens, with 70 percent being homemakers who have found financial freedom and a business identity without having to step outside their homes.” Meesho plans to use the new funds to further build its technology platform to accommodate new product lines, and to evolve its analytics and machine learning platforms to handle national scale. At the same time, in addition to expanding its network coverage to new geographies, the company will further deepen its operations in existing geographies.Meesho claims that it has built a network of more than two million ‘social sellers' across 700 towns in India, and create a disruptive distribution channel for 15,000 suppliers in traditional manufacturing hubs. With a focus on apparel, home, wellness, and electronics items, the company has a mission to create 20 million entrepreneurs by 2020.  Ashutosh Sharma, Head of India Investments, Naspers Ventures added that the phenomenal growth they are already experiencing shows that Meesho has hit a sweet spot in the market and is well-poised to serve the next 500 million online shoppers in the country.(Edited by Saheli Sen Gupta)Also ReadHere's how Facebook aims to strengthen the small and medium business ecosystem in India \"",

We have learnt that perks and rewards cannot be one-size-fits-all across corporates, as employees from different companies have different needs, although employees within the same company tend to look for/behave in a similar manner. We will be deploying this growth capital to build deeper insights, and to also become a more holistic benefit platform for employees catering to their wellness, financial and experiential needs.\"Also Read[Funding alert] HRTech startup Kredily raises $750,000 in seed funding led by Fosun RZ Capital Launched in 2016 by Sourabh Deorah and Smiti Bhatt Deorah, Advantage Club is an HR tech platform that helps corporates improve employee engagement and retention by providing perks, rewards and recognition.  The startup aggregates offers across 10,000+ brands including Samsung, Faasos, PNB Housing, Myntra, Apollo Pharmacy, among others. With 250+ corporate clients including Concentrix, EY, DXC and Mphasis, it helps organisations to elevate employee engagement, enabling brands to identify, target, and run data-driven campaigns.  Manu Rikhye, Partner at growX Ventures said, “Organisations of all sizes and scale face the challenge of improving employee engagement and retention. Simultaneously, brands are looking for ways of engaging directly with their consumers and understanding their behaviour and preferences. Advantage Club is well positioned to address both these needs, allowing brands to create products and offers that best suit their target audience, while employees get unparalleled perks.” Prior to this round, Advantage Club had raised $700,000 in two rounds of funding from Axilor Ventures, Purvi Ventures, Mumbai Angels, and other marquee investors.Last month, growX Ventures also invested an undisclosed sum in a Bengaluru-based spacetech startup Pixxel.

Existing investors Kalaari Capital and Silicon Valley-based early-stage fund 500 Startups also participated.The OxfordCaps team intends to use the funding to expand to 10 cities and also standardise its product. Founded in 2017 by Annu Talreja, an INSEAD alumni, and Priyanka Gera, an IIM Calcutta alumni, OxfordCaps provides young millennials and students with housing facilities that are standardised. The Delhi- and Singapore-based startup, which follows a full-stack model, leases out existing hostel buildings or other buildings that are suitable for student accommodation, renovates them to suit a standardised pattern, and rents out these properties as single, twin-sharing, and triple-sharing rooms, as well as dormitories. It also provides fully-furnished accommodation with WiFi, high-end security systems, food and maintenance. Speaking about the fund raise, Annu says, Student accommodation in India is a challenge. Currently, most follow a PG format or are available on campus. The challenge here is lack of quality and poor standard of maintenance and service. We aim to change that.”She says that their primary focus is to expand across India and in Singapore. They are also looking at bringing design standardisation as the rooms in several buildings need to be renovated to accommodate better storage, natural light, and ventilation. The company claims that it has clocked 30x growth in less than 10 months in India, growing from 200 beds to 6,000. The team is looking to expand in education hubs such as Delhi-NCR, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Pune, Indore, Jaipur and Dehradun.The team at OxfordcapsAlso read: Delhi-based Studentacco has 14,000 beds under its belt, aims to crack the $3-mn student accommodation market in IndiaCommenting on the investment, Abhishek Gupta, VP - Times Internet Ltd., said in a press statement, “Annu and Priyanka have built a great team in a short time, and their execution has been impressive. Education and Student Lifecycle are the key segments for us as an investor. We believe that there is a tremendous demand in this segment, coupled with founders' relentless hustle, it has the potential to transform the industry.”Currently, OxfordCaps charges based on accommodation and area. For budget accommodation, it charges anywhere between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000 per bed per month, depending on the area, and can go up to Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000. In Singapore, the team follows a management-led model, where they have tied up with a few leading universities to manage their hostels. The team charges 7-12 percent of the fee charged to the student by these hostels, as its management fee.Also read: This startup brings disruption to India's student housing space with international standardsAccording to JLL, the market for student accommodation seems to be growing in India, where it is believed to be worth $15 billion. A survey conducted in 2017 suggested that there were close to 50 lakh students enrolling in colleges and universities across 20 cities in the country.Currently, startups in the space include Placio, which raised $2  million in Pre-series A funding led by Prestellar Ventures, as well as Delhi-based Student Acco, which is primarily focussed on student housing. Even startups like OYO are now looking at the student accommodation space. Speaking of why they chose to invest in OxfordCaps, Vani Kola, Managing Director at Kalaari Capital, said in a statement: “More than 10.4 million students across India migrate to cities every year to pursue their academic dreams. However, student housing today suffers from a high level of fragmentation, lack of quality solutions, price transparency, reliability and complete lack of tech enablement of processes. OxfordCaps is addressing this gap. We are pleased to back Annu and Priyanka and are confident in their strategy and execution to establish student housing as an asset class in India.”Also read: This startup brings disruption to India's student housing space with international standards \"",
